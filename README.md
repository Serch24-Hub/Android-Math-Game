# Android-Math-Game
Android App
For my MAC220 final project, I created MathGames!!!, an Android app that includes four game modes: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app starts with a main menu that connects to each game activity using buttons, and I used view binding to make the code cleaner and easier to manage. Instead of using RecyclerView, I chose LiveData because it felt more intuitive for the way I wanted the app to work. This project was something I had tried to build before in other languages, but thanks to Professor Cordioâ€™s lessons and examples throughout the semester, I was finally able to bring the idea to life in a working app.

Because of the size of the App, Github doesn't allow me to upload it, so you can requested to me, by making a commit.
